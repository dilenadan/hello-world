Test all the other students concerning their status regarding your measures
This seminar could preferably be carried out in groups of 4 - 6 students. Transform the schemas from seminar 4 to generalized rules and/or principles and then to measures. There should be an explicit description of how you could measure your progress day by day without applying too much energy to the measurements
Transform all your formal plans into measures of success
Make an assignment of weight on each measure
If necessary divide each measure into operational definitions that can be checked daily
